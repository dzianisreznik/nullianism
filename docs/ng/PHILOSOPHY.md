# Filosofi of Nullianity

## Di Highest Value — To Sabi di World

Our highest value na to sabi di world. Di better we understand di world wey dey around us, di more effective we fit take reach our goals, no matter wetin dem be. From dis value, humanism follow: human life na di main value because death go remove person chance to dey learn.

## Foundation — Scientific Approach

Unlike traditional religions wey stand on belief, Nullianity stand on doubt, critical thinking and scientific method. We no dey accept any statement without evidence.

## How We Take God and Supernatural Matter

For Nullianity, God no dey, because science never discover am. Dis religion dey act like atheism for function. We no talk say God no dey at all, but we dey live as if no better evidence show say e exist. If science prove say deity dey, Nullianity go accept di fact.

## Life After Death: Immortalism

Instead make we believe for after-life, Nullianity bring di idea of **Immortalism** — di push to stop or push physical death far away with science and technology. We no dey prepare for death, we dey try avoid am. Any Nullian normally gree for technological immortality and resurrection if di chance show for future.

## Enemies of Nullianity

Di main antagonist of Nullianity na **anti-argumentation**:

- To spread disinformation on purpose.  
- To dey look down on science and facts.  
- To settle quarrel with force instead of logic and better argument.  
- To dey play on emotion instead of reason.  

We dey fight harmful ideas, no be people.
