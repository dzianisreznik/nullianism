# Manifesto of Curiosity

For too long dogma don divide humanity, blind us with uncritical beliefs, and hold us down with inherited `truths`. But inside every human mind dey one fire — the hunger to ask questions, explore, and look for truth beyond tradition.

We be heirs of the great road of thinkers — from the first astronomers wey map the stars, to the modern scientists wey dey open the secrets of the universe.

We dey stand for the doorway of one new era. The world no need faith for the unknowable again — e need commitment to wetin person fit know, prove, and make possible. Time don reach to clear new road, where curiosity go be sacred, reason go dey honoured, and knowledge go shine like guiding star.

- **Knowledge na moral duty.** To learn na to free yourself; to teach na to free others.
- **To spread knowledge na the highest ethical act.**
- **Doubt na holy.** Questions no dey weaken us; dem dey make us stronger. If one belief no fit survive test, e no deserve to stay.
- **The universe na our temple.** Wetin dey awe us no be supernatural, na the greatness of the cosmos and the complexity of nature.
- **Progress pass tradition.** The past fit guide, but e no be chain. If new knowledge scatter old beliefs, we go accept the new one.
- **We be community of Seekers.** Nobody dey waka the road alone. We pledge to support one another for the hunt for truth, share ideas, argue, and refine dem.
- **This no be just philosophy — na movement.** We wan not only think different, but change the world.

The future belong to the seekers, no be the obeyers.  
The era of blind faith don finish.  
The era of Curiosity dey start now.

You no need baptism, blessing, or permission. All wey you need na courage to ask: Wetin else I fit learn?
