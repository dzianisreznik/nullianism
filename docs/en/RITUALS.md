# Rituals of Nullianity

Rituals in Nullianity are practices aimed at strengthening the values of knowledge, critical thinking, and community building.

1.  ### Quest (from Eng. *Question*)
    Start your morning with a question. During the day, try to find an honest answer to it. Don’t hesitate to ask others—those who understand the issue better than you do.

2.  ### Base-checking, or the Double Fact-Checking Ritual
    If you’re writing a substantive comment or post, verify the accuracy of the information twice, preferably using different sources. As a sign that you’ve done this, place the sacred symbol **0** at the beginning of your message. This is your mark of responsibility for your words.

3.  ### The Gesture of Pure Intention
    When speaking face to face and you wish to ask a question out of genuine curiosity rather than to argue, you may trace a zero (0) in the air with your finger. This shows your interlocutor the purity of your intentions. The person addressed will treat the question with special respect.

4.  ### Nullification
    A mental exercise to test the strength of your arguments. Ask yourself: “If someone used my very arguments to prove something I consider utter nonsense, would I change my view of that nonsense?” This helps reveal double standards in one’s thinking.

5.  ### Circle of Reason
    Nullians invite friends and acquaintances home for intellectual leisure: watching films together, discussing books, playing board games. This fosters community and spreads the ideas of Nullianity through shared activities. The game *Fallacymania*, which teaches how to spot fallacies in a debate, is especially valued.

6.  ### Antiprayer
    Instead of appealing to abstract higher powers for help, Nullianity urges seeking solutions to problems through practical steps. Antiprayer is a process:
    1.  Clearly formulate the problem.
    2.  Consider what exactly you can do to solve it.
    3.  Assess whether you have sufficient knowledge.
    4.  If not—find where you can obtain it, or seek assistance from experts.
