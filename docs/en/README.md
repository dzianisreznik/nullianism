# Nullianity 

> The world's first scientific Open-Source religion.

Welcome to the Nullianity repository — a scientific religion created by Alexander Panchin. This is not a joke or clickbait, but a social experiment and an attempt to create a value system based not on dogmas and faith, but on curiosity, critical thinking, and a scientific approach.

## Core idea

Nullianity is a religion intended to unite people not around a deity or deities, but around human curiosity. We use the “shell” of religion — its powerful mechanism for spreading ideas and building communities — but fill it with rational and humanistic content.

**Our symbol is Zero (0).** It represents:

- The absence of dogmas and prejudices.  
- The starting point of knowledge.  
- Equal distance of all participants from the center, the absence of hierarchy.  
- A ring of reason that unites people.  

## Repository structure

- [**Curiosity Manifesto (`MANIFESTO.md`)**](./MANIFESTO.md) — the main programmatic text of our religion, generated by artificial intelligence.  
- [**Commandments (`COMMANDMENTS.md`)**](./COMMANDMENTS.md) — 8 key principles that guide a Nullian.  
- [**Rituals (`RITUALS.md`)**](./RITUALS.md) — practices that help strengthen and spread the ideas of Nullianity.  
- [**Philosophy (`PHILOSOPHY.md`)**](./PHILOSOPHY.md) — a detailed exposition of main values, worldview, ethics, and the enemies of Nullianity.  
- [**How to contribute (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — rules for those who want to participate in developing this religion.  

## How to become a Nullian?

If you share the ideas laid out here, consider yourself already a Nullian. No formal procedures are required. Our religion is decentralized.
