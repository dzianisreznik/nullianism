# How to Contribute

Nullianity is an open-source religion. Anyone can contribute to its development.

## How to do it?

1. **Propose ideas via Issues:** If you have a suggestion for a new commandment, ritual, refinement of the philosophy, or just a thought for discussion, create a new Issue in this repository.  
2. **Submit changes via Pull Requests:** If you want to fix a typo, improve wording, or add something specific to existing files, fork the repository, make your changes, and send a Pull Request.

## Core Principles

- **Alignment with the philosophy:** All proposals must align with the core values of Nullianity: curiosity, a scientific approach, critical thinking, and humanism.  
- **Constructiveness:** Discussions must be respectful. We critique ideas, not people.  
- **No dogma:** Nullianity is a living, evolving system. Be prepared for your ideas to be challenged, and stay open to changing them in light of new facts and arguments.

Letâ€™s build the religion of the future together!
