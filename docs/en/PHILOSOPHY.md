# The Philosophy of Nullianity

## Highest Value — Knowing the World

Our highest value is the understanding of the world. The better we understand the surrounding world, the more effectively we can achieve our goals, whatever they may be. From this value flows humanism: human life is the main value, because death deprives a person of the ability to learn.

## Foundation — The Scientific Approach

Unlike traditional religions based on faith, Nullianity is founded on doubt, critical thinking, and the scientific method. We do not accept claims without evidence.

## Attitude toward God and the Supernatural

In Nullianity there is no God, because science has not discovered one. It is a functionally atheistic religion. We do not claim that God definitely does not exist, but we act on the assumption that there is no convincing evidence for His existence. If the existence of a deity is scientifically proven, Nullianity will accept this fact.

## Life After Death: Immortalism

Instead of belief in an afterlife, Nullianity offers the idea of **immortalism**—the pursuit of preventing or maximally delaying physical death through science and technology. We do not prepare for death; we try to avoid it. A Nullian by default gives consent to technological immortality and resurrection should such an option become available in the future.

## Enemies of Nullianity

The main antagonist of Nullianity is **anti-argumentation**:

- Deliberate dissemination of misinformation.
- Disdainful attitude toward science and facts.
- Settling disputes by force rather than with logic and reasoning.
- Manipulating emotions instead of appealing to reason.

We fight not against people but against harmful ideas.
